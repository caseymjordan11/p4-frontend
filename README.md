Technologies used: 

I used a MERN stack to build an app that recommends a type of food to eat based on answers to a quiz and then recommends restaurants in your area that meet the quiz's recommendation. 

I used Pigeon Maps as a map component to display retaurants returned from the Yelp API. 
It's deployed using MLab Heroku and Surge at https://indecisive-chef.surge.sh.

Wireframes are added in a folder.

A major hurdle was sorting through the Yelp API. It seemed pretty intuitive but ended up needing to be proxied through the back end to work, which took awhile to figure out. 

Because of this I wasn't able to add in user authentication to the app, as I ran out of time. But this is something that I definitely want to add later.
